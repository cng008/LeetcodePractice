This solution first handles the edge case where k is greater than the length of nums. In this case, k is reduced to its equivalent value within the range [0, nums.length - 1].
​
Next, the solution uses the reverse function to reverse the entire array, the first k elements, and the remaining elements in turn. This effectively rotates the elements in the array by k positions.
​
The reverse function uses a simple loop to swap the elements at the start and end indices, moving inward one position at a time until the start and end indices meet in the middle. This reverses the elements within the specified range in the array.
