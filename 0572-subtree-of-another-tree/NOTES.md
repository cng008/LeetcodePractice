To solve this problem, you can use a recursive approach to check whether the given tree t is a subtree of the larger tree s.
​
One way to do this is to use a depth-first search through the larger tree s to find a node that has the same value as the root of the tree t. Once you find a matching node, you can then compare the two trees to see if they are identical.
​
The isSubtree function performs a depth-first search through the larger tree s and checks if the current node is a subtree by calling the isSameTree function. The isSameTree function compares the two trees to see if they are identical by checking if the values at each node are the same and if the left and right subtrees are also the same.
​
This solution has a time complexity of O(n * m), where n is the number of nodes in the larger tree s and m is the number of nodes in the tree t. The space complexity is O(m), since at most, the recursive stack will have m levels.
