If the elements at the left and mid indices are in ascending order, it means that the pivot point must be on the right side of the mid point, and the target can only be present in the left half of the array if it is within the range between the left and mid indices. Similarly, if the elements at the left and mid indices are not in ascending order, it means that the pivot point must be on the left side of the mid point, and the target can only be present in the right half of the array if it is within the range between the mid and right indices.
