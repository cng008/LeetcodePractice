To solve this problem, you can use a binary search approach. The idea is to find the pivot point, which is the point where the rotation occurs. You can do this by comparing the mid element with the rightmost element. If the mid element is greater than the rightmost element, it means that the pivot point is on the right side of the mid point, and you should search the left half of the array. If the mid element is smaller than or equal to the rightmost element, it means that the pivot point is on the left side of the mid point, and you should search the right half of the array.
